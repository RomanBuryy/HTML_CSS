        Steven Paul Jobs was an American business magnate, industrial
        designer, investor, and media proprietor. He was the chairman, chief executive officer (CEO), and co-founder of
        Apple Inc.; the chairman and majority shareholder of Pixar; a member of The Walt Disney Company's board of
        directors following its acquisition of Pixar; and the founder, chairman, and CEO of NeXT. Jobs is widely
        recognized as a pioneer of the personal computer revolution of the 1970s and 1980s, along with his early
        business partner and fellow Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak.

        Jobs was born in San Francisco, California, and put up for adoption. He was raised in the San Francisco Bay
        Area. He attended Reed College in 1972 before dropping out that same year, and traveled through India in 1974
        seeking enlightenment and studying Zen Buddhism.
